Currently I am doing my BE engineering from Sri Manakula Vinayagar Engineering, Pondicherry in computer science branch. I am really an enthusiastic student. So far I have maintained a CGPA of 9.56/10 which comes under a considerable rank in my university. I really like learning new things. So far, I far learnt web development using html,css,javascript and nodejs, and I like doing competitive programming. I am really interested in learning about web development using reactjs. I got to know about this course and I found it really comprehensive and interesting. But my financial requirement doesn’t allow me to purchase the course. If I am given the right opportunity to take this course I’ll give my 100% towards it. I’ll devote myself towards it and work regularly and follow all the instruction given to me. After learning this course I’ll definitely become a more productive person to my society and will contribute me best for its remarkable growth.
Hope my request will be take into consideration and I’ll get the golden opportunity to utilise these resources under my financial allowance. Thank you in advance.
